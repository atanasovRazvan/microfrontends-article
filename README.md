# Step #1

This step is all about initial project structure. Create a main folder, and run the following command:
```js
npx create-mf-app
```

Except the name and the port, everything is default.  
This should result in a boilerplate application, we are going to go throughout everything later on.  
Also, don't forget one important thing, which is `npm install`.
